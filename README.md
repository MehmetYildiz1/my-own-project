# Task Manager

Task maanger is a simple task management app with the aim of giving the basic
knowledge of development and processes inisde the company. The technology depends on the intern, but most of the time
it will be React, Angular for we frontend or Andorid and iOs and TypeScript/PHP/Java for backend.

## Breakdown

The project will consist from 2 parts: Frontend and Backend.
*Frontend* is the user interface. This is what user sees in browser or mobile application.
*Backend* is where the logic stands. This is the connection to the backend all the communication with the database and the 
interaction between the entities and so on.

## Features

In this project we are aiming on the basics of almost all projects that our company works on.

### Authentication

 - An already existing user should be able to provide email/username and password and if they are corrent the user should login

### Task Management
 - An user should have a list of previously created tasks
 - An user should be able to create a task by providing a description.
 - An user should be able to toggle task as done
 - An user should be able to delete an existing task

## The way of working
As an intern you should create a branch from your own branch. For each feature that you work create you have to create a new branch.
After the feature is impemented create a merge request from `feature_branch` to `my_original_branch` and ask somebody to review your code.
